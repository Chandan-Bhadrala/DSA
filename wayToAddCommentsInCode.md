/*
    Goal:
        Compute sum and product of digits of an integer.

    Idea:
        - Use modulus (%) to extract last digit.
        - Use integer division (/10) to remove the last digit.
        - Accumulate the sum and product.
        - Repeat until no digits remain.

    Why this works:
        Every base-10 integer is decomposable into digits using % and /.
