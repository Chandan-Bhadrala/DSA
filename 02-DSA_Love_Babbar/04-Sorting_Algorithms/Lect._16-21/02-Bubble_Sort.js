// # Bubble Sort.
// 1. In this method, we will keep comparing the adjacent elements of the array and will keep swapping the bigger element with the smaller elements to create an array of the ascending array elements.
// 2. We will loop step 2 continuously, till we swap no two-elements in a loop.
// 2.1. Will declare and re-initialize a boolean variable in every loop with false value.
// 2.2. Will only update the boolean variable to true once there is any swap occurs in a loop.
// 3. If no swap occurs in a loop and we terminate a loop with the boolean variable as false, then that will indicate the array has been sorted.

//-----------------

// 01. A function implementation of the **Bubble Sort**.
function bubbleSort(arr) {
  let sortArr = [...arr];
