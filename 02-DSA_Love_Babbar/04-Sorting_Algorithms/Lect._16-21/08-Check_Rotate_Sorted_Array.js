/**
# Check if rotated and sorted array.
## Question:
  1. We will be given an array and we have to check whether the given array is rotated and sorted or not.
  2. We have to return a boolean.
## Solution Approach:
  1. Check whether the break in the ascending order of the array is not more than one.
  2. Also check that the last element of the array is smaller than the first element of the array, to ensure the **circularity** in the array elements sorting and the rotations.
