// -----------------------------

// ## Rotate Array by 90 degrees - in-place rotation, intelligent and practical solution. Production grade or production needed.
// Production needed in-place manipulation. As array could easily contains millions or billions of entry.
// So, creating a copy of an array could be memory in-efficient or costly.
function rotateArrayBy90(matrix) {
  
}

// --- Output:
console.log(
  "Rotate given array by 90 degrees:",
  rotateArrayBy90(
    [
      [1, 4, 7],
      [2, 5, 8],
      [3, 6, 9],
    ]
