/**
# Find Duplicates.
- Using Linked List and fast and slow pointers.
- I don't know linked list yet.
- So, will do it with freqArray and will do it with LL and slow and fast pointer later.
- After learning the LL.

## Question:

## Solution Approach:
*/

// -----------------------------
function findRepeatedValue(arr) {
  let biggestNum = arr.length;

  // Use map to find the repeating value using map.has or use freqArray to count the index with value more than 1.
}


// --- Output:
console.log(findRepeatedValue([1, 2, 3, 2]));

// 2 is a repeating value.
