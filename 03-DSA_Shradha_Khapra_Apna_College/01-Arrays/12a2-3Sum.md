### return Array.from(ansSet).map(item => item.split(',').map(Number));
### Q1) I understood we're creating an Array and breaking individual items of the array using comma separator. But in the end we are using .map(Number). Can you explain this part.

When you use `.split(',')`, JavaScript takes a string like `"1,2,3"` and turns it into an array of **strings**: `["1", "2", "3"]`.

Since your original data consisted of **numbers**, you need to convert those strings back into actual number types.

### How `.map(Number)` works

The `.map()` function executes a callback on every element of the array. In JavaScript, `Number` is a built-in constructor function that converts a value to a number.

Writing `.map(Number)` is a clean, shorthand way of writing:

```javascript
.map(value => Number(value))

```

### Step-by-Step Breakdown

Let's look at what happens to a single item inside your `ansSet`:

1. **The Set Item:** `" -1,0,1"` (A string)
2. **`.split(',')`**: Becomes `["-1", "0", "1"]` (An array of **strings**)
3. **`.map(Number)`**:
* Takes `"-1"`, runs `Number("-1")`  returns `-1`
* Takes `"0"`, runs `Number("0")`  returns `0`
* Takes `"1"`, runs `Number("1")`  returns `1`


4. **Result:** `[-1, 0, 1]` (An array of **numbers**)

### Why is this necessary?

If you skip `.map(Number)`, your final output would look like this:
`[["-1", "0", "1"], ["-2", "0", "2"]]`

By adding it, you ensure the data types match your original input:
`[[-1, 0, 1], [-2, 0, 2]]`

### Pro-Tip: Avoid the "Split" Headache

If you use `JSON.stringify()` to save the array and `JSON.parse()` to retrieve it (as shown in my previous reply), you don't need to manually map the numbers. `JSON.parse()` automatically recognizes the numbers and restores them to the correct type.

Would you like to see how to implement this using a **Map** instead of a **Set** to optimize the search part of your loops?
