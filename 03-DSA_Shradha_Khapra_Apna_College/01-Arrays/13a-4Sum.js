## Question:
1. We'll be given an array and we've to find the four array elements at the unique indices whose sum is equal to the given target.

## Solution Approach O(n^3): 
1. To solve we've to use 3 nested for-loops.
2. In the inner most for-loop use two pointer approach to find the pair of elements which complements the array elements of the outer loops elements i.e., arr[i] and arr[j].
