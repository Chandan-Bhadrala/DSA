/**
# Binary Exponentiation.

## Question:
1. Calculate power of num using Binary Exponentiation.

## Solution Approach:
1. It's similar to the Fast Exponentiation.
2. Benefit: Helps making calculation for the big exp value faster and possible even for too high value of exp.

// -----------------------------

function binaryExponentiation(num, exp) {}

// --- Output:
console.log(binaryExponentiation(2, 16));
